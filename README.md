# News-Classification-using-Word-Vector
A machine learning project that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using spaCy word vectors and scikit-learn classifiers. The system converts raw text into semantic embeddings and evaluates multiple models — including Multinomial Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest — to determine the most effective approach for fake news detection.
